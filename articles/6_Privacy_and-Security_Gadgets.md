## Basics
(All products in this section have been tested.)

**Item** | **Description**
--- | ---
**USB Data Blocker**<br>[![Data Blocker](https://i.ibb.co/jG3dpGW/1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2HDArRP) | There are many exploits that allow an attacker to infect your device with malware and/ or steal data, when you plug it in to what appears to be a USB power outlet. If you are charging your phone while travelling, a USB data blocker will prevent anything other than power from getting to your device, by removing the connection between the 2 data wires. The PortaPower brand, also comes with a fast charging chip, since without the data connection your device would otherwise charge at minimum speed
**Microphone Blocker**<br>![__](https://i.ibb.co/BKQTCbQ/2.jpg) | A microphone blocker is a device that prohibits audio hacking, in the form of a hardware accessory for a smartphones, laptops etc. It functions as a dummy mic jack, so the device thinks it has a microphone plugged in, and hence disables the internal one
**Faraday Pouch**<br>![__](https://i.ibb.co/HBBG0QL/3.jpg) | [Faraday Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) is an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic fields. It is useful to keep any device which could be hacked through sending or receiving signals in such a case, such as car keys, or a smart phone. [Larger](https://amzn.to/2UTZOGM) versions are available for tablets and laptops.
**RFID Blocking Cards**<br>![__](https://i.ibb.co/m4GtMdj/4.jpg) | If you are concerned about card skimming, you can use an RFID blocking sleeve to protect your contactless payment and identity cards. However there are proportionately very few RFID-skimmer crimes reported, and most credit cards have a low contactless limit
**Web Cam Covers**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/X7B1WsH/5.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2uEz16H) | Web cam covers are quite self-explanatory, they physically conceal the lenses on your laptop or phone camera, to prevent a malicious actor (hacker, government, corporation etc) from watching you through the camera. It may sound paranoid, but unfortunately it happens, and it is a relatively simple process for someone to gain remote access to a webcam. Even Mark Zuckerberg [covers his webcam](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-tape-webcam-microphone-facebook)! Of course you could just use some tape, rather than buying a cover
**Prokey Wallet**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/m53MmCL/prokey.jpg)](https://prokey.io) | Prokey Optimum is a secure, easy-to-use offline hardware wallet, that works directly through the browser (on Windows, Mac, Linux and Android), without the need for installing any apps. Both the firmware and browser app is [open source](https://github.com/prokey-io), and it natively supports [over 1000 coins and tokens](https://prokey.io/all-coins). It's affordably priced at £42/ $59, with free world-wide shipping and customer support
**Port Blockers**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/fYPVnK5/6.jpg)](https://amzn.to/327Yn9n) | There are many attacks that involve an attacker inserting a USB device (such as a BadUSB/ Rubber Ducky/ Malduino) to an open USB port. Adding a port blocker doesn't render you safe from this, since the attacker could take the time to try and remove it, but it could protect you for an opportunistic attack
**Privacy Filter**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/KjkTbGN/7.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3bAa9xv) | Privacy filters are polarized sheets of plastic, that when placed over a computer screen prevent screen visibility from any angle other than straight on. They make it harder for anyone to look over your shoulder and see your data confidential
**YubiKey**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/PGtbwxN/8.jpg)](https://amzn.to/38wcG9R) | The YubiKey is a small hardware device used to secure access on mobile devices, computers, and servers to all of your online accounts. It allows for second-factor authentication, hence protecting anyone other than you from logging in. It is said to be more convenient and more secure than using a mobile authenticator, but there are reasons for and against
**Encrypted Kingston Data Traveler**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/ScRFhdt/9.jpg)](https://amzn.to/38xsnO5) | Good value, easy-to-use with no installation required. Built-in hardware encryption and high password protection. Also optionally allows for automatic cloud backup option to protect against data loss (which doesn't say much about their faith in this USB device, but jokes aside-) this is a very affordable and well rated little device
**Hardware Encrypted USB 3.0 Drive**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/p3MzFHF/11.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2vD32Ug) | OS & Platform independent, with 100% hardware encryption, so it works perfectly with all operating systems. USB 3.0 with Read/Write Speeds of 116/43 MBps. GDPR compliant and FIPS 140-2 Level 3, NLNCSA DEP-V & NATO Restricted Level Certified with real time military grade AES-XTS 256-bit hardware encryption
**Hardware Encrypted External Hard Drive**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/BV5k29v/12.jpg)](https://amzn.to/37pTmK8) | Similar to the iStorage hardware encrypted USB 3.1 drive, this external hard drive has high capacity and strong hardware encryption. Data is encrypted with FIPS PUB 197 Validated Encryption Algorithm, and against a 7 - 15 digit alpha-numeric pin, with erasing capabilities for multiple failed login attempts
**Bootable Drive Eraser**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/P11d0YH/15.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2SsL67Y) | Easy-to-use bootable USB will completely erase your hard drive with military grade destruction, making it near-impossible for any files or personal data to be recovered. This should be done before you sell, or dispose of any hard drive. Of course there are various .ISOs you can download and flash to a USB yourself if you do not want to spend money, but this USB supports all devices and is quick and easy to use, with excellent results
**Mobile Privacy Screen**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/Zg9QG1j/17.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2OZO3Lc) | Similar to the laptop/ monitor privacy filter, this screen protector will prevent anyone from seeing what is on your screen when reading from an angle
**Kensington Lock**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/TKHV5d3/20.jpg)](https://amzn.to/38zu0e2) | Quite self-explanatory, this lock will make it harder for someone to steal your laptop, and get to your data. Of course it does require that your laptop has the [Kensington Security Slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Security_Slot), which many do
**Anti-Surveillance Clothing**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/Gk8jBBm/21.jpg)](https://adversarialfashion.com) | Facial recognition is being rolled out in most countries now, the patterns on these clothes, will confuse facial, object and number plate recognition, injecting junk data in to the systems, hence making it harder for automated systems to monitor and track you
**Solo Key**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/8PFQRDy/26.jpg)](https://solokeys.com) | Another FIDO2 physical security key for 2-facto authentication and storing encryption keys. SoloKeys have both open source hardware and software, they are easy to use out of the box, but can also be used for developers and makers, since there is a well documented CLI
**Nano Ledger**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/HdVyPzb/22.jpg)](https://amzn.to/37q1cn6) | If you are in possession of Bitcoin or other crypto then one of the most secure ways to store, send and receive coins is with a hardware wallet. Ledger has a solid reputation when it comes to hardware encryption, and the main principle behind their wallets is to provide full isolation between the private keys and your easy-to-hack computer or smartphone
**Cold Storage**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/nj6xyv1/23.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2HqVy9x) | If you are not planning on spending your crypto any time soon, and do not want to trust a tech-based solution, then consider this metal cold storage wallet. Unlike writing your private key down on paper, this will not fade, and cannot be destroyed by water, fire of other environmental circumstances. Of course you could just engrave your key on a small sheet of aluminium
**Deauth Detector**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/BqNGRCW/19.jpg)](https://dstike.com/products/dstike-deauth-detector-v3pre-flashed) | Most WiFi hacks begin by sending deauth packets, so that connected clients will briefly be disconnected to the network. This [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) comes pre-flashed with [@SpaceHuhn's](https://github.com/spacehuhn) deauth detector (which you can view [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/spacehuhn/DeauthDetector)). Once it detects [deauthentication or disassociation frames](https://mrncciew.com/2014/10/11/802-11-mgmt-deauth-disassociation-frames), it will activate a speaker to notify you
**WiPhone**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/grnJjKt/wiphone.jpg)](https://www.wiphone.io/) | A fully open source, modular and easily customizable phone for VOIP and LoRa. Great for making free calls over WiFi, communicating locally over LoRa, or just tinkering thanks to its ESP32 pinouts
**Librem 5**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/3TNh5Vt/l5-v1-front-100x100.png)](https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) | Security and Privacy focused smart phone by Purism. With hardware kill switches and specially designed software, this device runs Linux, and does not track you. It Separates CPU from Cellular Baseband, uses IP-Native Communication First and Decentralized Communication by Default. The source code is user-controlled, and has layered security protection. Purism also have [other security-focused products](https://puri.sm/products)
**Slate Travel Router**<br>[![__](https://i.ibb.co/Nt7hmfW/ar750s-ext-1000x1000.jpg)](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar750s/) | The GL-AR750S-Ext can serve as a Wi-Fi access point, a pfSense firewall or a portable router with always-on VPN connectivity. It's great for controlling your network (firewall, VPN, ad-block, web filtering, data limits and more) when traveling or away from home


## DIY Security Products

Don't want to spend money? Most of the products above, plus some that wearn't included can be built at home with some pretty simple hardware and open source software. The following list will point you in the right direction to start making!

See Also [DIY Networking Hardware](#diy-networking-hardware)

- **Network-wide add-block** - [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net) is a simple yet powerful app, that can be installed on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), and once you've updated your routers DNS servers to point to it, all resources on the blacklist will be blocked, at the point of origin. This makes it much more powerful than a browser add-on, and will also speed your internet up
- **USB Sanitiser** - [CIRCLean](https://www.circl.lu/projects/CIRCLean) is a hardware solution to clean documents from untrusted (obtained) USB drives. It automatically converts untrusted documents into a readable but disarmed format and stores these clean files on a trusted (user owned) USB key/stick.
- **Bootable Drive Eraser** - You can flash the [DBAN](https://dban.org) or [KillDisk](https://www.killdisk.com/killdisk-home.htm) ISO file onto a USB, boot from it and securely, fully wipe your hard drives. This is useful to do before selling or disposing of a PC.
- **Deauth Detector** - Since most wireless attacked begin by sending out deauthentication packets, you can flash SpaceHuhns [DeauthDetector](https://github.com/spacehuhn/DeauthDetector), onto a standard ESP8266 NodeMCU, plug it in, and wait to be notified of wireless deauth attacks
- **AI Assistant Mod** - [Project Alias](https://github.com/bjoernkarmann/project_alias) runs on a Pi, and gives you more control and increased privacy for both Google Home and Alexa, through intercepting voice commands, emitting noise interference + lots more
- **Tor WiFi Network** - Using [OnionPi](https://github.com/breadtk/onion_pi), you can create a second wireless network, that routed traffic through Tor. This is very light-weight so can be done with just a  [Pi Zero W](https://amzn.to/2Urc0hM). Here is a configuration [guide](https://www.sbprojects.net/projects/raspberrypi/tor.php)
- **Credential Recall Card** - A password card is a unique grid of random letters and digits, that lets you generate, store and recall unique and strong passwords for your accounts. Generate your own unique password card, and read more via: [PasswordCard.org](https://www.passwordcard.org/en)
- **Faraday Case** - If you want to block signals for devices such as car keys, smart phone, laptop or even just RFID-enabled cards and passports, you can line a box or pouch with [Faraday Fabric](https://amzn.to/2ORKtTr)
- **Hardware Wallet** - Using the Trezor Shield or [Trezor Core](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware) and a Raspberry Pi, you can create your own hardware wallet for safley storing your crypto currency private keys offline. See [this guide](https://github.com/Multibit-Legacy/multibit-hardware/wiki/Trezor-on-Raspberry-Pi-from-scratch) for building. If you enjoyed that, you can also run your own Bitcoin and  Lightning Node [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz)
- **Encrypted USB** - You can use [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) to create an encrypted USB drive, using any off-the shelf [USB drive](https://amzn.to/2RykcLD)
- **Home VPN** - [Pi_VPN](https://www.pivpn.io) lets you use [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net) to connect to your home network from anywhere, through your [Pi](https://amzn.to/2uniPqa). See [this guide](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-vpn-server) for set-up instructions. This will work particularly well in combination with Pi Hole.
- **USB Password Manager** - Storing your passwords in the cloud may be convenient, but you cannot ever be certain they won't be breached. [KeePass](https://keepass.info/help/v2/setup.html) is an offline password manager, with a portable edition that can run off a USB. There's also an [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.korovan.kpass). See also [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org) and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) which are popular community forks with additional functionality
- **Secure Chat Platform** Tinfoil Chat (TFC) is an onion-routed, endpoint secure messaging system, that relies on high assurance hardware architecture to protect users from passive collection, MITM attacks and most importantly, remote key exfiltration. See [TFC](https://github.com/maqp/tfc)
- **Automated Backups** - [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) is a privacy-focused continuous file synchronization program. You can use it to make on-site backups as well as encrypted and sync your data with your chosen cloud storage provider
- **GPS Spoofer** - If you don't want to be tracked with GPS, then using a SDR you can send out spoof GPS signals, making near-by GPS-enabled devices think that they are in a totally different location. (Wouldn't recommend using this while on an airplane though!). You can use [gps-sdr-sim](https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim) by [@osqzss](https://github.com/osqzss), and run it on a [Hacker RF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf) or similar SDR. Here's a [guide](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/gps-spoofing) outlineing how to get started, you'll also need a HackRF One or similar [SDR](https://amzn.to/39cLiOx). Check your local laws first, you may need a radio license.
- **No-Mic Laptop** - You can go one step further than using a mic-blcoker, and physically remove the microphone from your laptop. (And then use a removable external mic when needed). See how, for [Apple MacBook and iPhone](https://www.wired.com/story/remove-the-mic-from-your-phone/) | [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-IwQMeVLc). If that seems to extreme, there are [other options](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/130402)

If you are confident with electronics, then you could also make:
- **USB Data Blocker** - By simple removing the data wires from a USB adapter, you can create a protector to keep you safe while charing your device in public spaces. See [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-USB-Condom) for more info (note: fast charge will not work)
- **Hardware Encrypted Password Manager** - Even better than a software-encrypted password manager, is the [hardpass0.2](https://bit.ly/3bg4Xi4) which is a very simple hardware-encrypted USB store, using [GnuPG Smart card](https://www.g10code.com/p-card.html), [GNU Password Standard](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and this [source code](https://github.com/girst/hardpass-passwordmanager) all running on a [Pi Zero](https://amzn.to/2Sz0vU4). See also the [Zamek Project](https://bit.ly/36ZJrec), using this [source code](https://github.com/jareklupinski/zamek) to achieve a similar functioning hardware-password manager
- **U2F USB Token** - Similar to the FIDO2 2-factor authentication USB keys, [U2f-Zero](https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero) by Conor Patrick, lets you turn a Pi Zero into a second-factor auth method. Note: project no longer actively maintained, see [NitroKey](https://github.com/nitrokey) instead
- **True Random Number Generator - Standalone** - The [FST-01](https://www.gniibe.org/FST-01/fst-01.html) is an open source hardware RNG with good documentation, and see the [neug source code](https://salsa.debian.org/gnuk-team/gnuk/neug)
- **PC auto-lock Flash Drive** - Turn a flash drive into a lock/ unlock key for your PC, allowing you to quickly lock your device when needed [deprecated]
- **Headless Pi Zero SSH server** - Create an small test server, that you can SSH into for development, in order to not have to run risky or potentially dangerous code or software directly on your PC


## Paranoid Security Gadgets

## Network Security

Gadgets that help protect and anonamise your internet, detect & prevent intrusions and provide additional network controls, both at home and while traveling. There are many products like this available, some of them are over-priced for what they are, others provide some really essential network security features.

## Hardware Encrypted Storage

Hardware-based encryption uses a device’s on-board security to perform encryption and decryption. It is self-contained and does not require the help of any additional software. Therefore, it is essentially free from the possibility of contamination, malicious code infection, or vulnerability, and able to be used on any platform.

If the device itself becomes compromised, your data will remain safe. Really useful backing up, transporting and sharing personal data safely. For maximum security, you can combine hardware encryption with software encryption.

Reliable options include:

- AES Hardware encrypted USB 3.0 external hard drive enclosure for HDD or SSD: [US]() | [UK](https://amzn.to/2GM3GkB)
- Integral 256-bit AES USB 3.0 (Software required), 16GB, 32GB, 64GB. [US]() | [UK](https://amzn.to/37vpyNb)
- iStorage 256-bit AES USB 3.0 Pro (Hardware Encrypted), with keypad, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB. [US](https://amzn.to/2T9wTgo) | [UK](https://amzn.to/2O1OPXu)
- IornKey Rugged Enterprise-grade encrypted USB Pen, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 128GB. [US](https://amzn.to/2wYWQH2) | [UK](https://amzn.to/3cjsnUi)

- iodd Mini USB 3.0 256-bit Secure encrypted SSD Drive. 256GB, 512GB, 1TB. [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Y4FR9H7)   

*Alternatively, a cheaper option would be a software-encrypted USB. [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) is cross-platform open source encryption application. It's surprisingly simple (see [this how-to guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/108501/the-how-to-geek-guide-to-getting-started-with-truecrypt)), and very secure. Combine this with an ordinary USB drive, this [high-speed (300mb/s) 256GB flash drive](https://amzn.to/2RykcLD) is a great option*

*For encryption your boot drive, you can use [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) (Windows), [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) (OSX), or any of these [options](https://www.tecmint.com/file-and-disk-encryption-tools-for-linux)  for Linux.*



## USB Data Blockers

Small, low-cost but essential device. It attaches in between your USB cable and the charging socket, and will physically block data transfer and syncing while charging. Totally mitigates the risk of being hacked via a USB exploit, and stops anything being uploaded to your device.

- PortaPow 3rd Gen, USB A, 2-Pack. [Red](https://amzn.to/39aStqE) | [White](https://amzn.to/2TqXl4i) | [Black](https://amzn.to/38imYd2)
- PortaPow Dual USB Power Monitor with Data Blocker, usful for monitoring power consumption and managing which devices are allowed data connections. [US](https://amzn.to/2I7HT7J) | [UK](https://amzn.to/3chnWcJ) 
- Privise USB A Data Blocker. [US](https://amzn.to/3cig0rr) | [UK](https://amzn.to/2VAbX3K)
- Data-only Micro-USB cable. Be sure that it is actually data-only, you can count the pins at each end. Again PortaPow make a legitimate safe-charge cable. [US](https://amzn.to/2Tq09ys) | [UK](https://amzn.to/38chHDF)
- USB-C ondom. An open source power-with-no-data USB-C data blocker. [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/CrowbarTech/usb-c-ondom/)

PortaPow (3rd gen) is one of the best options, since it has a SmartCharge chip (which isn't usually possible without the data wire).

You can also build your own very easily, [here is a schematic](https://www.electroschematics.com/diy-usb-condom-circuit).

Word of Warning: Sometimes the cable itself can be dangerous. See [O.M.G Cable](https://shop.hak5.org/products/o-mg-cable), it looks like a totally authentic phone cable, but is actually able to deploy advanced exploits often without you being able to identify. It is always best label your cables, to ensure you are using your own, safe wire.


## FIDO U2F Keys

Or check out [NitroKey](https://github.com/nitrokey), for a guide on building U2F with an ESP-8266, see [this Hackaday article](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/04/two-factor-authentication-with-the-esp8266/) 



## Crypto Wallets

The most secure medium to store your currency is cold (offline) wallets, since they cannot be hacked. Of course it is vital that you keep your private keys somewhere that they cannot be stolen, and cannot be lost or destroyed. Electronic devices can make it easy to securely store and spend crypto currency. Choose a wallet that is open source, and with a good reputation. Ensure you backup your seed, and keep it somewhere safe.
